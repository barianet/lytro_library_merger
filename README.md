Lytro Library Merger
====================

Merges all photos of a Lytro library to user's main Lytro library.

**BACKUP YOUR LYTRO LIBRARY BEFORE RUNNING THIS APPLICATION!**

Given a Lytro photo library, this application merges/imports all
Lytro photos and metadatas from the given library to user's main library,
which is the one that Lytro desktop application uses.

This application does its best to prevent any damage to your photo library
and revent the changes when something goes wrong. But you should not count
on this, so PLEASE BACKUP YOUR LYTRO LIBRARY BEFORE RUNNING THIS APPLICATION!
