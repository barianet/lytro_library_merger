Lytro Library Merger
====================

Fork me on GitHub: https://github.com/behnam/lytro_library_merger

At the moment, only Windows 7 is supported. A little work is needed to
make it work for Mac OS X. Let me know if you do so!

The only software dependency is Python 2.7.  Get it from http://www.python.org/getit/
